## Introduction

Dengue causes 400 million infections worldwide every year, leading to 100 million becoming ill and 21,000 deaths (making it the most impactful arboviral disease in humans). Case incidence is increasing exponentially, from 0.5 million cases in 2000 to 5 million in 2019.[@worldhealthorganization2023DengueSevereDengue; @kularatne2022DengueInfectionGlobal; @bhatt2013GlobalDistributionBurden]

Four serotypes Second infection most severe Since early 2000s dengue outbreaks in Sri Lanka have become larger and multiple serotypes are now circulating [@tam2013EstimatesDengueForce] Vector control is main focus of prevention efforts [@achee2015CriticalAssessmentVector; @kanakaratne2009SevereDengueEpidemics].

## Background

Background on trial Based on cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) of spatial repellents currently being conducted in Sri Lanka A trial for the same intervention was recently conducted in Iquitos, Peru Primary endpoint: seroconversion of baseline seronegative/monotypic individuals Parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial with 13 clusters per arm (26 clusters total), 60 individuals in each cluster Ran for approximately 3 years Spatial repellents reduced Aedes-borne virus transmission by 34.1% (a significant difference) Iquitos and SL have different FoIs and reporting rates, which affects endpoint and sample size calcuations

## Research questions

How many individuals do we need to include in our trial of an intervention against dengue, and how does this differ by endpoint?

## Objectives

1.  Know S4 in Colombo for age ranges (find the Lambda in Colombo)

2.  Get disease data for Colombo and Gampaha

3.  Link lambda with disease in Colombo (find Rho)

4.  Using the Rho from Colombo, find the number of, passive surveillance cases, acive surveillance cases and Infections (through seroprevalence. Find Lambda with disease in Gampaha with the Rho of Colombo

5.  Calculate the number of participants needed in a cluster randomised trial.

### Deriving lambda and initial conditions for Colombo

We take the probability of first infection of \~ 14.1%.[@tam2013EstimatesDengueForce],

$$
P(First\;Infection|No\;Infection) = 1 - (1 - \lambda)^{4}= 0.141\
\\\
\\
therefore \; \lambda = 0.037
$$

We ran the simulation for 100 years, as the burn-in period. We determined the proportion of each susceptibility status per age.

## Obtaining disease data for Colombo and Gampaha

Annual reported cases averaged over 5 years per 10 000 population is 100/10 000 pop. in Colombo and 77/10 000 pop in Gampaha. (ref)

## Calculate Rho

$$
\rho = P(case|I2)  = case detection proportion/ I2
$$

## Determine Lambda in Gampaha

We estimated the relationship between force of infection and reported cases in Colombo, assuming all reported cases are due to secondary infections. We also assumed the force of infection to case relationship is the same in both areas.

### Case definitions

We assume 100% Sensitivity and specificity in all diagnostics.

**Passive surveillance case** - Symptomatic infections that presents to a health facility in Gampaha in year x.

$$
PassiveCase  = I2*P(case|I2)
$$

**Infection Surveillance** - Any positive identified by Dengue IgG or IgM in Gampaha in year x.

$$
InfectionCase = I2
$$

## Assumptions

We assume age distribution in Gampaha and Colombo are the same.

## Power Calculations

### Equations

$$
n= (Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} \quad + \quad Z_\beta) ^2 \frac{\pi_0(1-\pi_0) + \pi_A(1-\pi_A)}{(\pi_0 - \pi_A)^2 }
$$

$$
\text{assuming} \; n \; \text{individuals per cluster, the necessary number of clusters is calculated:} 
$$

$$
c = 1 + (Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} \quad + \quad Z_\beta) ^2 \frac{\frac{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)}{n}+ \frac{ \pi_A(1-\pi_A)}{n} + k^2 (\pi_0^2 + \pi_A^2) }{(\pi_0 - \pi_A)^2 }
$$

## Results

#| label: fig-lambdacalc
#| fig-cap: "DIagram of the proportion of estimated to Colombo with varying Force of infection. We assume Colombo has a lambda of 0.037 ( derived from Primary infection incidence) and that Gampaha has 77% of the cases in Colombo. We also assume that cases are secondary infections." 
#| echo: false

{
plot(x = I2_vec/I2_vec[38], y = lambda_vals, type = "l", 
     xlab = "Modelled cases proportional to Colombo" , 
     ylab = "Force of Infection")
abline(v = 1.0)
abline(h = lambda_vals[38])
abline(v = 0.77)

abline(h = lambda_vals[15])

### Model output

```{r}
#| label: fig-modeloutput
#| fig-cap: "Output"
#| echo: false

source("createPlots.R")

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-sampsi
#| fig-cap: "The sample sizes needed to show \_pi sample size for k clusters and n participants."
#| echo: false
plot_sample_infections()
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-sampsiinfection
#| fig-cap: "The Sample sizes needed to show \_pi sample size for k clusters and n participants."
#| echo: false

plot_sample_infections()

```

We present the samples size on the x axis and clusters on the y axis for varying effect size $\pi_{diff}$ and inter-cluster coefficient $k$.

## Next Steps

-   Time-varying force of infection

-   Time-varying serotype circulation (which serotypes, how many serotypes)

-   Making the model stochastic (i.e. doing a random draw based on the probability of infection)

-   Using a range of force of infection estimates for a few years (reflecting inter-annual variation of FoI during the trial)

-   Accounting for temporary- and maternal antibody-induced cross-protection (if we run the model on a smaller timestep)

-   Variation in detection probability (age-dependent, time-varying, dependent on force of infection)

-   Account for sensitivity and specificity of test (for detecting seronegatives and monotypic individuals)

-   Account for loss to follow-up

-   Account for the number of children we would need to test (when using infections as events) and what proportion would need to be excluded due to existing multitypic immunity

-   Cost-effectiveness of using different events (seroconversion vs. reported cases) as endpoints (accounting for cost of testing, number of participants to be followed, length of study)
