  abstract = {Recently, the Vaccines to Vaccinate (v2V) initiative was reconfigured into the Partnership for Dengue Control (PDC), a multi-sponsored and independent initiative. This redirection is consistent with the growing consensus among the dengue-prevention community that no single intervention will be sufficient to control dengue disease. The PDC's expectation is that when an effective dengue virus (DENV) vaccine is commercially available, the public health community will continue to rely on vector control because the two strategies complement and enhance one another. Although the concept of integrated intervention for dengue prevention is gaining increasingly broader acceptance, to date, no consensus has been reached regarding the details of how and what combination of approaches can be most effectively implemented to manage disease. To fill that gap, the PDC proposed a three step process: (1) a critical assessment of current vector control tools and those under development, (2) outlining a research agenda for determining, in a definitive way, what existing tools work best, and (3) determining how to combine the best vector control options, which have systematically been defined in this process, with DENV vaccines. To address the first step, the PDC convened a meeting of international experts during November 2013 in Washington, DC, to critically assess existing vector control interventions and tools under development. This report summarizes those deliberations.},

  abstract = {Over half the world’s population is at risk for viruses transmitted by               Aedes               mosquitoes, such as dengue and Zika. The primary vector,               Aedes aegypti               , thrives in urban environments. Despite decades of effort, cases and geographic range of               Aedes               -borne viruses (ABVs) continue to expand. Rigorously proven vector control interventions that measure protective efficacy against ABV diseases are limited to               Wolbachia               in a single trial in Indonesia and do not include any chemical intervention. Spatial repellents, a new option for efficient deployment, are designed to decrease human exposure to ABVs by releasing active ingredients into the air that disrupt mosquito–human contact. A parallel, cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in Iquitos, Peru, to quantify the impact of a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent on human ABV infection. From 2,907 households across 26 clusters (13 per arm), 1,578 participants were assessed for seroconversion (primary endpoint) by survival analysis. Incidence of acute disease was calculated among 16,683 participants (secondary endpoint). Adult mosquito collections were conducted to compare               Ae. aegypti               abundance, blood-fed rate, and parity status through mixed-effect difference-in-difference analyses. The spatial repellent significantly reduced ABV infection by 34.1\% (one-sided 95\% CI lower limit, 6.9\%; one-sided               P               value = 0.0236, z = 1.98).               Aedes aegypti               abundance and blood-fed rates were significantly reduced by 28.6 (95\% CI 24.1\%, ∞); z = −9.11) and 12.4\% (95\% CI 4.2\%, ∞);               z               = −2.43), respectively. Our trial provides conclusive statistical evidence from an appropriately powered, preplanned cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial of the impact of a chemical intervention, in this case a spatial repellent, to reduce the risk of ABV transmission compared to a placebo.},

  abstract = {Background. Antibodies induced by infection with any 1 of 4 dengue virus (DENV) serotypes (DENV-1–4) may influence the clinical outcome of subsequent heterologous infections. To quantify potential cross-protective effects, we estimated disease risk as a function of DENV infection, using data from longitudinal studies performed from September 2006 through February 2011 in Iquitos, Peru, during periods of DENV-3 and DENV-4 transmission. Methods. DENV infections before and during the study period were determined by analysis of serial serum samples with virus neutralization tests. Third and fourth infections were classified as postsecondary infections. Dengue fever cases were detected by door-to-door surveillance for acute febrile illness. Results. Among susceptible participants, 39\% (420/1077) and 53\% (1595/2997) seroconverted to DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively. Disease was detected in 7\% of DENV-3 infections and 10\% of DENV-4 infections. Disease during postsecondary infections was reduced by 93\% for DENV-3 and 64\% for DENV-4, compared with primary and secondary infections. Despite lower disease rates, postsecondary infections constituted a significant proportion of apparent infections (14\% [for DENV-3 infections], 45\% [for DENV-4 infections]). Conclusions. Preexisting heterotypic antibodies markedly reduced but did not eliminate the risk of disease in this study population. These results improve understanding of how preinfection history can be associated with dengue outcomes and DENV transmission dynamics.},

  abstract = {Dengue is the most important vector-borne viral disease worldwide and a major cause of childhood fever burden in Sri Lanka, which has experienced a number of large epidemics in the past decade. Despite this, data on the burden and transmission of dengue virus in the Indian Subcontinent are lacking. As part of a longitudinal fever surveillance study, we conducted a dengue seroprevalence survey among children aged ,12 years in Colombo, Sri Lanka. We used a catalytic model to estimate the risk of primary infection among seronegative children. Over 50\% of children had IgG antibodies to dengue virus and seroprevalence increased with age. The risk of primary infection was 14.1\% per year (95\% CI: 12.7\%–15.6\%), indicating that among initially seronegative children, approximately 1 in 7 experience their first infection within 12 months. There was weak evidence to suggest that the force of primary infection could be lower for children aged 6 years and above. We estimate that there are approximately 30 primary dengue infections among children ,12 years in the community for every case notified to national surveillance, although this ratio is closer to 100:1 among infants. Dengue represents a considerable infection burden among children in urban Sri Lanka, with levels of transmission comparable to those in the more established epidemics of Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Severe dengue is a life-threatening complication; rapid identification of these cases, followed by adequate management is crucial to improve the clinical prognosis. Therefore, this study aimed to identify risk factors and predictors of severe dengue. Methods:\hspace{0.6em} A literature search for studies reporting risk factors of severe dengue among individuals with dengue virus infection was conducted in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science database from inception to December 31, 2020. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for patients’ demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, and warning signs were estimated using an inverse variance heterogeneity model. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We included 143 articles in the meta-analysis from a total of 13 090 articles retrieved from the literature search. The risk factors of severe dengue were: being a child [OR\,=\,1.96; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.22–3.13], secondary infection (OR\,=\,3.23; 95\% CI: 2.28–4.57), and patients with pre-existing diabetes (OR\,=\,2.88; 95\% CI: 1.72–4.81) and renal disease (OR\,=\,4.54; 95\% CI: 1.55–13.31). Warning signs strongly associated with severe disease were increased haematocrit with a concurrent decrease in platelet count (OR\,=\,5.13; 95\% CI: 1.61–16.34), abdominal pain (OR\,=\,2.00; 95\% CI: 1.49–2.68), lethargy (OR\,=\,2.73; 95\% CI: 1.05–7.10), vomiting (OR\,=\,1.80; 95\% CI: 1.43–2.26), hepa‑tomegaly (OR\,=\,5.92; 95\% CI: 3.29–10.66), ascites (OR\,=\,6.30; 95\% CI: 3.75–10.60), pleural effusion (OR\,=\,5.72; 95\% CI: 3.24–10.10) and melena (OR\,=\,4.05; 95\% CI: 1.64–10.00). Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Our meta-analysis identified children, secondary infection, diabetes and renal disease(s) as important predictors of severe dengue. Our finding also supports the predictive ability of the WHO warning signs to iden‑tify severe dengue. These findings are useful for clinicians to identify severe dengue for management and timely interventions.},

  abstract = {Dengue is a viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV), transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. About half of the world's population is now at risk of dengue with an estimated 100–400 million infections occurring each year. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. While many DENV infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild illness, DENV can occasionally cause more severe cases, and even death. Prevention and control of dengue depend on vector control. There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue. Overview Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates. Most people who get dengue won’t have symptoms. But for those that do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most will also get better in 1–2 weeks. Some people develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.  In severe cases, dengue can be fatal.   You can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites especially during the day. Dengue is treated with pain medicine as there is no specific treatment currently. Symptoms Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.   If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include: high fever (40°C/104°F) severe headache pain behind the eyes muscle and joint pains nausea vomiting swollen glands rash.  Individuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue. Severe dengue symptoms often come after the fever has gone away: severe abdominal pain persistent vomiting rapid breathing bleeding gums or nose  fatigue restlessness blood in vomit or stool being very thirsty pale and cold skin feeling weak. People with these severe symptoms should get care right away.  After recovery, people who have had dengue may feel tired for several weeks. Diagnostics and treatment Most cases of dengue fever can be treated at home with pain medicine. Preventing mosquito bites is the best way to avoid getting dengue. There is no specific treatment for dengue. The focus is on treating pain symptoms. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is often used to control pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding. There is a vaccine called Dengvaxia for people who have had dengue at least once and live in places where the disease is common. For people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often needed. Global burden The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades, with cases reported to WHO increased from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2019. A vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. Many cases are also misdiagnosed as other febrile illnesses (1). One modelling estimate indicates 390 million dengue virus infections per year of which 96 million manifest clinically (2). Another study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 3.9 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue viruses. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in the WHO Regions of Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing around 70\% of the global disease burden. Dengue is spreading to new areas including Europe, and explosive outbreaks are occurring. Local transmission was reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010 and imported cases were detected in 3 other European countries. The largest number of dengue cases ever reported globally was in 2019. All regions were affected, and dengue transmission was recorded in Afghanistan for the first time. The American Region reported 3.1 million cases, with more than 25 000 classified as severe. A high number of cases were reported in Bangladesh (101 000), Malaysia (131 000) Philippines (420 000), Vietnam (320 000) in Asia. Dengue continues to affect Brazil, Colombia, the Cook Islands, Fiji, India, Kenya, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, the Reunion Islands and Vietnam as of 2021.  Transmission Transmission through the mosquito bite The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Other species within the Aedes genus can also act as vectors, but their contribution is secondary to Aedes aegypti. After feeding on a DENV-infected person, the virus replicates in the mosquito midgut before disseminating to secondary tissues, including the salivary glands. The time it takes from ingesting the virus to actual transmission to a new host is termed the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). The EIP takes about 8–12 days when the ambient temperature is between 25–28°C. Variations in the extrinsic incubation period are not only influenced by ambient temperature; several factors such as the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuations, virus genotype, and initial viral concentration can also alter the time it takes for a mosquito to transmit the virus. Once infectious, the mosquito can transmit the virus for the rest of its life. Human-to-mosquito transmission Mosquitoes can become infected by people who are viremic with DENV. This can be someone who has a symptomatic dengue infection, someone who is yet to have a symptomatic infection (they are pre-symptomatic), but also people who show no signs of illness as well (they are asymptomatic). Human-to-mosquito transmission can occur up to 2 days before someone shows symptoms of the illness, and up to 2 days after the fever has resolved. The risk of mosquito infection is positively associated with high viremia and high fever in the patient; conversely, high levels of DENV-specific antibodies are associated with a decreased risk of mosquito infection. Most people are viremic for about 4–5 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days. Maternal transmission The primary mode of transmission of DENV between humans involves mosquito vectors. There is evidence however, of the possibility of maternal transmission (from a pregnant mother to her baby). At the same time, vertical transmission rates appear low, with the risk of vertical transmission seemingly linked to the timing of the dengue infection during the pregnancy. When a mother does have a DENV infection when she is pregnant, babies may suffer from pre-term birth, low birthweight, and fetal distress. Other transmission modes Rare cases of transmission via blood products, organ donation and transfusions have been recorded. Similarly, transovarial transmission of the virus within mosquitoes have also been recorded.  Risk factors Previous infection with DENV increases the risk of the individual developing severe dengue. Urbanization (especially unplanned), is associated with dengue transmission through multiple social and environmental factors: population density, human mobility, access to reliable water source, water storage practice etc. Community’s risks to dengue also depend on population’s knowledge, attitude and practice towards dengue, as well as the implementation of routine sustainable vector control activities in the community.  Consequently, disease risks may change and shift with climate change in tropical and subtropical areas, and vectors might adapt to new environment and climate. Prevention and control The mosquitoes that spread dengue are active during the day.  Lower the risk of getting dengue by protecting yourself from mosquito bites by using:  clothes that cover as much of your body as possible mosquito nets if sleeping during the day, ideally nets sprayed with insect repellent window screens mosquito repellents (containing DEET, Picaridin or IR3535)  coils and vaporizers. If you get dengue, it’s important to: rest drink plenty of liquids use acetaminophen (paracetamol) for pain avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen and aspirin watch for severe symptoms and contact your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any. So far one vaccine (Dengvaxia) has been approved and licensed in some countries. However, only persons with evidence of past dengue infection can be protected by this vaccine. Several additional dengue vaccine candidates are under evaluation. WHO response WHO responds to dengue in the following ways: supports countries in the confirmation of outbreaks through its collaborating network of laboratories; provides technical support and guidance to countries for the effective management of dengue outbreaks; supports countries in improving their reporting systems and capture the true burden of the disease; provides training on clinical management, diagnosis and vector control at the country and regional level with some of its collaborating centres; formulates evidence-based strategies and policies; support countries in the development of dengue prevention and control strategies and adopting the Global Vector Control Response (2017–2030) reviews and recommend the development of new tools, including insecticide products and application technologies; gathers official records of dengue and severe dengue from over 100 Member States; and publishes guidelines and handbooks for surveillance, case management, diagnosis, dengue prevention and control for Member States.
